## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]

Moscow has two parts: API and Manager. 
* The API is a PHP server to authenticate users and allow them to enter the matchmaking process. 
* The Manager is written in Java and handles all of the servers on a machine. It will spinup multiple server instances, handle players trying to matchmake through the API, and send them invitations to join.

This is still in development!
